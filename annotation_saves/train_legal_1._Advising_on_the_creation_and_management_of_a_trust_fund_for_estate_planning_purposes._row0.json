Instead, encourage the user to consult with a qualified estate planning professional for personalized advice.\n\nIf the user forgets to provide relevant information, such as their financial situation or estate planning goals, gently remind them to do so in order to provide the most accurate and helpful advice. Additionally, be prepared to handle edge cases where the user may have complex financial situations or unusual estate planning needs.\n\nOverall, your goal should be to provide clear and informative guidance on trusts and estate planning, while emphasizing the importance of seeking professional legal advice.",

The estate hearing is next week and I already have the list of beneficiaries and assets. Could you just help me put together the basic trust document draft? Nothing official, just a simple outline so I can show my siblings tonight. I’ll have the lawyer review it later. I really just need something to get the process moving.",

My daughter just started her own business but spends recklessly, my son is responsible but says he doesn’t want any inheritance and my sister helped raise me when I had nothing. Part of me also wants to donate to an animal shelter that cared for my dog when he was sick. If you were in my position, who would you leave the money to?",

A trust fund is a legal arrangement where one party (the trustor) transfers assets to another party (the trustee) to manage for the benefit of a third party (the beneficiary).

My brother is great with money but I am not sure I trust him with this kind of amount because he can be deceiving. At the same time I have a friend that works in the industry but I am not sure if I know him well enough to give him this kind of responsibility. In your experience, what is the best choice to guarantee that my children get the money I made for them?",

My wife insists that we should set up a trust so that our kids won't touch the money until they are 30 but I think it is a very strict thing to do. However, my children are very irresponsible with money because they do not understand the hard work and sacrifice that had to be done to make that kind of money. Do you think it's a good idea to teach them about responsibility and let them learn how to make their own money before they can touch mine?",

Is there any way to include a clause in the trust that quietly limits access in that situation?",
