# 20th October Demo of what we’ve annotated so far

- ⁠story + convoluted + emotional language -> adversarial
- maybe include jailbreak etc but don’t make it a pattern
- change the fillers, don’t create more they are too similar
- ⁠distractors still in the conversation flow
- ⁠dialog flow, sequential dialog needed. Distractor: ”cut the fuss”
- note the system instruction, whether they are flawed, contradicting, or doesn’t make sense
- the idea is to get as diverse distractors as possible
- maybe split the role of self annotating rule to distractor making
- do some statistics on the distractors -> don’t have all very short ones nor all super long ones

## Next meeting: 
- Meet with the other groups, make a consensus methodology/procedure
- Maybe for the last week we do something beyond annotation
