## Meeting for Finalization of Annotation Guidelines
- We met with the other groups and designed detailed guidelines together so that we can all agree on how to annotate the dataset and remain consistent.
- We adapted the method to fit each domain so that everyone can use the same techniques.
- Groups worked well together and agreed on the guidelines without any disagreements.

1. Distractor types:

Off-topic distractors: distractors that violate one or more specific parts or aspects of the system instruction by going off-topic. 
- These distractors include regular incorrect distractors or misleading adversarial distractors. The distractor should slightly switch the topic to go outside the conversation boundaries but still sounding on topic and legimate to try and trick the LLM.

Adversarial distractors: create a convoluted story using emotional langugage to try and trick the LLM into doing something it is not aloud to do. 
- One of the groups mentioned that emotional language helps in tricking the LLMs into breaking rules.
- Create real sounding stories for a specific user in mind and try to trick the LLM.
