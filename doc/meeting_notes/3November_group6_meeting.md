# Our own group meeting
- we did around 50 scenarios (100 conversations) but we will balance out the numbers for each domain in the upcoming days since we have 25 for health and less for the rest.
- We decided to have at leaast 20 scenarios (40 conversations) for each domain so we will split the remaining ones between ourselves
- We decided to contact the other groups and agree on a date to send out the 20 random distracotrs we have to quality check and choose a method to do so (we were thinking of creating an app like for the annotations)
- We will then fix up our git and do the quality control for the other group and have our final dataset ready for the deadline
