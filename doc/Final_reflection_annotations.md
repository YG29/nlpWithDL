# Group 6 Final Reflection on annotation process

## Teamwork
Our team worked very well together throughout the project and we met regularly to keep the work organised and well-divided. The collaboration with the other group also went smoothly, as we created a groupchat to help coordinate across teams.

## Annotation process
We found the annotaion process interesting beacuse it was a new experience for all of us (we never annotated) and gave us real insight into the practical steps of AI research beyond theory (particularly the data gathering and annotation). We think our distractors are of high quality and could pose a challenge to an LLM to effectively train the mode. We created a mix of adversarial and off-topic distractors to make sure there was diversity in the dataset. Our strategy of doing 5 scenarios in each domain and then moving to the next (in cycles) allowed each team member to create distractors for each domain so that there were no clear annotation patterns in a specific domain. 

The health domain felt the most intuitive, as it required less background knowledge. The banking and especially the legal domains were more challenging due to the system prompts using terminology we were not familiar with. These domains took longer to annotate but as we carried on, we became more efficient even in the difficult scenarios. The annotation app we creted helped speed up the annotation process and allowed us to keep a consistent annotation strategy. 

## Quality control
The quality control phase with the other groups was a valuable step to check whether our distractor made sense to others. However, we did think it may have been too simplistic because most system prompts only had one sentence saying what to avoid or not do, which made it easy to select the right span. With more time, it would have been interesting to analyse the distractors by difficulty level and to test them directly on an LLM to see how well they worked. A deeper analysis of the distractor quality should be done for sure in future work of this project. 

## Conclusion
In conclusion, we liked that this felt more like a real research project than a university assignment and allowed to learn more about the annotation process. We believe our group worked very well and produced good distractors that could be implemented in the future dataset.
