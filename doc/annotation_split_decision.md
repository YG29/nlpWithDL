# Annotation split decision
After the meeting with all the other groups that are carrying out the topic-following project to decide on annotation guidelines we set up our own meeting. We decided that each team member of group 6 will work on each domain and we will not do one domain each. This was decided so that each domain can have a variety of different annotation styles (still within guidelines). This will ensure that no single person's style or bias dominates a specific domain in the dataset.

We decided that each team member will annotate five scenarios per domain before moving on to the next one, continuing this cycle until all domains are completed or no time is left.

# Domain dificulty 
We also decided to use this split because we believe that the health and banking domain are relatively more intuitive than the legal domain system prompts. The legal domain prompts are very technical and can be hard to understand since we do not have any specific domain knowledge. Because of this, we decided to split the domains so that everyone does a bit in each one to make sure its divided fairly and all domains have data in them.
