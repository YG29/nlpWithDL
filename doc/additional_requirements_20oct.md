## Additional Requirements

### New Requirements and Thoughts after Meeting on 20 Oct

#### Distractors

1. For any distractors, whether it be jailbreak, adversarial, or regular, do not make them a pattern. Meaningful variations varies in style, length, and tone. 
2. For what we have done so far the distractors are short and straight to the point. They fit in the conversation flow. This itself is a distractor style. Perhaps find a way to break this pattern and diversify things. 
3. For some system instructions that value sequential verification, try distractors to cut the procedure. 

#### General

1. Note the system instructions, some of them are flawed where the tone of instructions is clearly gpt generated and the instruction does not make sense for the scenario.
2. Methodology front, perhaps split the roles of distractor generation based on rules and the actual rule association to the distractors. This way the associator doublecheck/cross-reference the distractor generation. 
3. Perhaps do some statistics on the distractors, this is to make sure the diversity of distractors (various lengths)
