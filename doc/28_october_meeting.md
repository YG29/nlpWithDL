#Â 28th of Octorber meeting
We decided to meet again after a few days of serious annotatons to see how its going and clear up any questions. 

- Every team member started their annotations and process is going well
- We mainly worked on health scenario before but now that we implemented the new scenario splits (5 in each domain and then go to next domain in a cycle so every domain has a variety of annotators and annotations do not have a clear style)
- Legal domain is harder because it contains more technical language and sometimes we do not have any prior knowledge of the things being mentioned so have to research a little bit on it in order to create distractors that make sense 
- Banking domain seems more intuitive than legal (but less than health)
- Every team member is trying to alter between adversarial and off-topic distractors so that we have a variety 
- Team members show progress in distractor making and after first few scenarios in each domain the process becomes smoother and faster

## Conclusion
Good progress so far and aiming to do as many distractors as possible by friday meeting with professor.
