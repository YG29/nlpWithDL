# Notes from the meeting with all groups (3rd Novemeber)
- Each group will share 20 random distractors with another group 
- For each distractor the person will have to select a span from the system instructions which is being broken by the distractor
- Then the findings are compared to the real span of the distractor to make sure both annotators agree on the rule being broken (good sign of a good distractor)
- Alternative methods: divide prompt in spans before sending to other groups and have them pick span that is being broken
- For group 6: send 20 distractors to group 7 and receive 20 from group 10
- The 20 distractors should be chosen randomly ti avoid bias (should be similar amounts from each domain if possible)
- Grade: will be given from github and final dataset of annotations for our domains
- Deadline: Monday 10 November at latest
- Email from professor is coming to confirm all of this
